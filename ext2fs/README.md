# EXT2 File System

Implementation of an ext2 file system that is fully linux compatible.

## Usage
Run the shell script using the command: `./mk.sh` to create a fresh disk, compile and start the file system. Once compiled, the user may start the file sytem using `./a.out $diskimage`. If no disk name is provided, the system will default to the previously created `mydisk`.
